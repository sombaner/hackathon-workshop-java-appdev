# Terraform Azure Project

This project contains the Terraform configuration files for provisioning resources in the Azure cloud.

## Project Structure

The project has the following files and directories:

- `main.tf`: This file contains the main configuration for the Terraform project. It defines the resources to be provisioned in the Azure cloud.

- `variables.tf`: This file defines the input variables for the Terraform project. It allows users to customize the configuration by providing values for these variables.

- `outputs.tf`: This file defines the output values that will be displayed after the Terraform provisioning is complete. It can include information such as resource IDs or connection strings.

- `providers.tf`: This file specifies the provider configuration for Azure. It defines the Azure provider and any required authentication details.

- `modules/example-module/main.tf`: This file contains the configuration for a module named "example-module". Modules are reusable units of Terraform configuration that can be used to encapsulate and organize resources.

- `modules/example-module/variables.tf`: This file defines the input variables specific to the "example-module" module.

- `modules/example-module/outputs.tf`: This file defines the output values specific to the "example-module" module.

- `.gitignore`: This file specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by version control systems like Git.

## Usage

1. Install Terraform on your machine.

2. Update the variables in `variables.tf` according to your requirements.

3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the project.

4. Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan.

5. Run `terraform apply` to provision the resources in Azure.

6. After the provisioning is complete, the output values defined in `outputs.tf` will be displayed.
